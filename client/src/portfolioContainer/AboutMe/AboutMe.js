      "I am a certified Software Engineer specializing in Android and web applications. During my university studies, I had gained a sense of team spirit, organization and problem solving. I have worked on multiple projects as an individual and as a part of a team.  My interest in software engineering started at an early stage of my university studies when I completed the software engineering class. Now I'm studying the MERN stack, so I can expand my knowledge to the web applications field. With these skill sets, i aim to bring added value and contribute to the companyâ€™s achievements where I am going to work. Despite my limited experience, I have the desire, resourcefulness and a can-do attitude to excel in the field as I learn on the job and grow with the company.",
